#+TITLE: guile-yaml

This Guile library is intended to make working with YAML files easier.
guile-yaml is mainly intended to serialize a Scheme association list to a YAML file.

NOTE: Currently guile-yaml does *not* support reading in a YAML file and constructing the alist right now!
Perhaps it will in the future.

guile-yaml closely follows the [[https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2][latest YAML specification]].

* Outputting YAML
To output to YAML, use the ~scm->yaml~ procedure.

* Testing
guile-yaml is tested with the [[https://github.com/yaml/yaml-test-suite][standard YAML test suite]] to ensure compliance with the YAML specification.
The YAML test suite is published by the same group that develops YAML's specification.
