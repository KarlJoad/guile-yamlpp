#+TITLE: guile-yaml

This Guile library is intended to make working with YAML files easier.
guile-yaml is mainly intended to serialize a Scheme association list to a YAML file.

NOTE: Currently guile-yaml does *not* support reading in a YAML file and constructing the alist right now!
Perhaps it will in the future.

guile-yaml closely follows the [[https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2][latest YAML specification]].

* Outputting YAML
To output to YAML, use the ~scm->yaml~ procedure.
